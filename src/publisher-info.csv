5,Activision,"**Activision Publishing, Inc.** is an American video game publisher based inSanta Monica, California. It currently serves as the publishing business forits parent company, Activision Blizzard, and consists of several subsidiarystudios.

Activision was the first independent, third-party, console video gamedeveloper. The 1983 video game crash, in part created by too many newcompanies trying to follow in Activision's footsteps without the expertise ofActivision's founders, hurt Activision's position in console games, forcingthem to diversify into games for home computers, including the acquisition ofInfocom. After a management shift, with CEO Jim Levy replaced by Bruce Davis,the company renamed itself as **Mediagenic** and branched out into businesssoftware applications. Mediagenic quickly fell into debt, and the company wasbought for around US$500,000 by Bobby Kotick and a small group of investorsaround 1991.Kotick instituted a full rework of the company to cover its debts: dismissingmost of its staff, moving the company to Los Angeles, and reverting to theActivision name. Building on existing assets, the Kotick-led Activisionpursued more publishing opportunities and, after recovering from the formerdebt, started acquiring numerous studios and intellectual properties over the1990s and 2000s, among these being the _Call of Duty_ and _Guitar Hero_series. A holding company was formed as Activision's parent company to managethe internal and acquired studios.

Within this structure, Activision serves tomanage numerous third-party studios and publish all of the parent company'sgames outside of those created by Blizzard."
